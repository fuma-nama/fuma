## HTMl

About the essence of **HTML** and **DOM tree**, I honestly think it is a bad design in modern web.
It does something different from native apps, and produces a lot of **redundant work**.

### JavaScript Bias

Why do we need to avoid scripts that much in web apps?

We developed **Hydration**, **Server-Side Rendering**, and a bunch of things to reduce the bundle size of JavaScript on client-side.
The reason why bundle size matters, is that it becomes heavy at some point of our development, and slows down the loading speed.

**Many APIs are offered by browsers:** UI, Audio APIs... Why is it heavy?

The reason is simple: How could you implement a popover component? Yes, you will go ahead and search for NPM modules that solves the problem.
**These packages increased your client bundle size**, but why the Popover API is arriving so late?

As of 2024 May, Popover is yet an experimental feature and has inconsistency problems.
**The problem turns out, to be a problem of HTML.**

### Lack of Flexibility

In HTML, We cannot make a proper implementation of complex, advanced components without **hacky ways**.

Like **Rich text editors, color pickers, checkbox with custom icons, customised select menus**, we ultimately _fixed_ it with JavaScript and some magic.
Why aren't they being offered by browsers? We obviously needed a better select menu that is more flexible, a more advanced input field with Rich text support.

Accessing the UI through DOM tree, **there are very few options to customise the elements**.
CSS as a styling language, can't be as flexible as JavaScript.
We cannot customise the dropdown menu of `<select />` and its logic with CSS, but neither with JavaScript.

HTML lacks of flexibility, and **these approaches are not performance efficient.**

### Performance

In a native app, UIs are built with code.
We can directly interact with components and even constructs them.
Like `new Spinner()` and do whatever we want.

Doing the same thing in HTML, we need to modify the DOM tree, inserting nodes by _passing HTML_,
so that browsers can parse that HTML and _make it back_ a native UI element.

Theoretically browsers will construct/update the DOM.
The work doesn't stop there, rendering engines have to do a bunch of things (e.g. recalculating, perform rearrangements to layouts) to actually update the UI.
it can be **expensive**, and finally you still have to find the node back in JavaScript just to interact with it.
As your web app grows,
**It becomes a heavy layer between the UI and JavaScript, and slows down the performance.**

It is negligible because rendering engines are incredibly fast.
However, remember the aforementioned flexibility problem? We spread `div` elements everywhere, using complex stylings and DOM structure to fix layout problems.
We developed virtual scroll in many ways, but it becomes difficult to fix cross-browser problems.
We developed rich text editor with `contentEditable` attribute, which apparently isn't something efficient.
**The lack of advanced elements forced us to take hacky, non-native path,** which makes performance worse.

Summing all side effects, can lead to a poor performance.

Can't we just skip HTML and write UIs with JavaScript?
Taking some references from native app SDKs,
all above can be simplified by a new API.

```jsx
const spinner = new Spinner();
spinner.setStyle({
    ...
})

container.insert(spinner)

// or just

container.insert(<Spinner style={{...}} />)
```

**Offer more native components, and let us declare it with code.**

### SEO

Some may argue that using JavaScript instead of HTML hinders **crawlers and SEO**,
but that is another problem with HTML.

**Meta tags are written for crawlers, not the users**, they should be staying away from the actual UI, but instead, they are loaded into all user’s devices through HTML.

We can just write something **specific to crawlers**, rather than putting everything to your HTML.
The idea of `robot.txt` is a nice example, we can have a crawler-specific file like `meta.xml` for search engines.

### Aesthetic?

The existence of Kotlin Compose, Swift and even JSX proven that it is possible to write something elegant with code and potentially “visualise your UI structure”.
**HTML stands no point from being a cleaner way to write UIs.**

Also we have been using bundlers and transpilers intensely nowadays, it is common to write JSX and compile back to JavaScript.

### Conclusion

In this article, I pointed out some problems I knew about HTML.
HTML isn't that terrible, rendering engines are written in low-level languages like C++, and they are quite fast.
However, it doesn't mean it is perfect. It has problems, especially when we are developing something more powerful.

Many amazing developers are putting great efforts to make the Web better, and it is never late in this ever-evolving industry.
