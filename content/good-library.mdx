## DX is Everything

The lifespan of a framework hugely depends on the experience of working in the codebase.
For open-source projects, the difficulty of contributing can change people's willingness to become contributors.

All contributors must understand how the codebase works, which is arduous for massive codebases.
That's why, the **readability** and **maintainability** of code often matter.

### Codebase

A good framework should have a good codebase.

#### Comment hacky workarounds

It's common to encounter some tricky problems, we often make hacky workarounds to "fix" them.
When doing so, write comments on these codes so that beginners can understand how it works.

#### Code Navigation

We usually navigate in a codebase with **files** and **functions**, a huge function or file takes more time for us to comprehend and potentially find its bugs.

- A function should never contain 300+ lines of code without an explanation/comment.
- A file should never contain 2000+ lines of code.
  In my experience, most of these huge files can be separated into multiple files.
  File navigation is often useful when we want to find the relevant code for a specific feature.
- A loop (e.g. if) should never contain 300+ lines of code, they are generally hard to read.

We create a separate function when:

- The code is reused
- The function/loop is too long
- Easier to write unit tests

We create a file when:

- To contain multiple single-purposed functions for a specific feature.
- For tree-shaking purposes (i.e. the implementation of a client-side utility, or a React.js hook).

### Fewer Features

Add features only if you can maintain them.

For every feature, you have to carry them on the codebase even when you deprecated them.
You will need to make a **major** release to remove them once you decide to support them.

```
Announced (Minor Release) -> Documented -> Deprecated -> Removed (Major Release)
```

Sometimes, it makes sense to sacrifice functionalities and flexibility for the maintainability of your project.

### Deprecate Features

Deprecate and remove legacy features.

It is a nice experience to update a library without changing the code, but it shouldn't be the case for major releases.
**The codebase will be bloated** if you decide to keep all deprecated features and options.

### Documentation for Contributors

We generally write docs for the users - people who use the framework.
However, for massive codebases, it's also important to write guides for the contributors to begin with.

For example, Next.js has a minimal guide to get started with contributing.
Although I won't say it's a satisfying experience (especially when you see the complexity of `next` itself), it is indeed helpful to me.

Remember to specify the workflow of contributing, for example:

- Run Lint.
- Run tests and update test snapshots if necessary.
- For new features, submit a feature request first.
- For bug fixes, submit a bug report first.

In this way, you can also ensure the standard quality of submitted PRs.
