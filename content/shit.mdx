## Some meaningless sentiments

My impulsive thoughts, might be incorrect though.

### Human is not perfect

I disagree that human is innately moral. Nothing is perfect outside of imaginary, so is human. The definition of moral is changing rapidly,
while our instinct is changing insignificantly. But we are bornt with our instincts, a decent education is always required for morality development.

Hence, nothing is as glorious as illustrated.
We generally have a functional brain. They share the same chemical structure and functionality. However, only a small group of people are considered as distinguishable and impactive.
I sometimes think, why do people overhype someone, and even promote them as the successoful life winners?
It is simply a sign of low-efficiency of resource management of our society.
Human owns the most intelligent brain on the earth, but most of them are doing boring, routine jobs like a factory labourer.
We are apparently capable of something higher.

### Human can't be useless

When I was a kid, my mother sometimes scold me "useless".
Of course, I know she was kidding. But to some individuals, they are really feeling depressed with real critics.

I believe nobody is useless. If a tool is considered to be useless, it can't satisfy its goal of being created.
Are we bornt as a tool? No, right? Never would we become a tool, because we are bornt for ourselves.
We own our life.

### How can you prove humans have a soul?

If dogs have a soul, how about mosquito?

Without the existence of religions, perhaps it is just something illustrated by humans to satisfy their desire for immortal.

### We are emotional

Our brain is driven by different hormones. Everybody is emotional, and we can't be always tranquil and logical.
It is more likely the nature of our body.
Maybe, we have endless desire for wisdom because we could never own it.

### Fate is deemed, but you don't need to think of its meaning

Just like nobody think of the meaning of a video when watching it. To me, it's pretty pointless to give a meaning for your life.

Have fun and that's enough.

### The Joy

I've struggled so many times on learning something new. I often ponder why do I need to learn it? To torture myself?
That's because I enjoy the joy of finding a truth, or a solution. It's sad that some people can't feel the joy of curiosity.

### Importance of leisure

I value my free time more than anything.
Modern people indeed need more leisure to think.
I have never thought entertainments like watching shortvideos can be relaxing.
Nothing is more comfortable than doing nothing.

### Ultra-processed food is not healthy.

I felt much better after stop taking unhealthy food.

### Human languages are worse than programming languages

Programming languages have no variantly, they consist a bunch of simple keywords and syntaxes.
Ain't they better than most human languages in terms of effectivity?
